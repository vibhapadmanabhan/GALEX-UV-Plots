# GALEX UV Plots
The files in this repo attempt to reproduce Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 from *Components of the Diffuse Ultraviolet Radiation at High Latitudes* (Akshaya et al., 2019)<sup>1</sup>, in the GDL (free clone of IDL) language. They work in tandem with two other scripts<sup>2</sup> written by Prof. Jayant Murthy, ``get_galex_hlsp_data.pro`` and ``create_wcs_map.pro``, who was the mentor for this project.

#TODO: Explain functioning of each script. Add image output files.
